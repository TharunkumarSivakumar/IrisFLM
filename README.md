# IrisFLM
Implemented a machine learning project to classify Iris flower species using the Iris dataset. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training multiple classification models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines. The Random Forest model was selected as the best performer based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics. Additionally, developed a Flask web application to deploy the trained model, enabling real-time predictions of Iris flower species based on user inputs.
